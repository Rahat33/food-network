            <h2>My Story</h2>

            <p class="story">Well, not all my recipes come with a story but many do.
                Food is often my main memory of a situation – be it a holiday, a day out, or a lunch with friends.
                I still remember sitting on a camping bench in Dhaka
                as a child, deboning a poulet fume and wondering how much I could get away with eating without getting
                caught.
                It’s these stories I will bring you. After all, everyone loves a story.

                <h2>Beef Steak</h2>
                <p>A beef steak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces, usually cut
                    perpendicular to the muscle fibers.</p>
